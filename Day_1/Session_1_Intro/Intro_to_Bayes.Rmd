## Learning aims

By attending this training, participants will:

- Perceive the logic of latent class models and their applicability in diagnostic accuracy studies in veterinary medicine

- Get acquainted with Bayesian Latent Class Models (**BLCMs**) basic principles & challenges

- Perform hands-on training on Sensitivity (*Se*) and Specificity (*Sp*) estimation with BLCMs

- Understand the importance of standards for reporting of diagnostic accuracy
studies that use BLCMs (STARD-BLCMs)

## Evaluation of diagnostic test accuracies
- «… indeed, when an existing test is considered as a reference, this suggests that the test in question is always correct, and that all misclassifications (false negatives, false positives) are due to the new test…»
- «Consequently, the new test will **never** be able to achieve sensitivity of 100%, since it is considered responsible for all misclassifications.»

## Historical sketch on (Bayesian) Latent Class Models

* Hui-Walter paradigm (1980)

  - A particular model formulation that was originally designed for evaluating diagnostic tests in the absence of a gold standard

  - Not originally/necessarily Bayesian - implemented using Maximum Likelihood 
  
  - But evaluating an imperfect test against another imperfect test is a bit like pulling a rabbit out of a hat

* If we don't know the true disease status, how can we estimate sensitivity or specificity for either test?

## Hui-Walter paradigm (1980)

Hui-Walter models implementation to be further discussed in the next session.

## Historical sketch on (B)LCMs

Joseph et al. (1995)  **Bayesian** estimation of disease prevalence and diagnostic test evaluation in the absence of a gold standard

- Remember Bayes' theorem? 
$P(\theta|Y) = \frac{P(\theta)\times P(Y|\theta)}{P(Y)}$

  * prevalence $\pi = P(D+)$ 
  * Sensitivity $Se_i = P(T_i+|D+)$ 
  * Specificity $Sp_i = P(T_i-|D-)$

  * Prior beta distributions for parameters of interest
      - $\pi \sim Beta(a_\pi,b_\pi)$ 
      - $Se_i \sim Beta(a_{Se_i},b_{Se_i})$
      - $Sp_i \sim Beta(a_{Sp_i},b_{Sp_i})$  
  
$Posterior \propto Likelihood \times Prior$

## Terminology *latent*

Yes, what does *latent* mean?

- The true infection status of an individual is unobserved-hidden/unknown, hence *latent*

- Instead of individuals being explicitly classified as *infected* or *uninfected*, each individual is assumed to have a probability of infection, given the combination of an observed diagnostic test outcome, knowledge on Se and Sp and prior knowledge of disease prevalence in the population of interest (Cheung et al. 2021).

- In a BLCM *latent* does mean soemthing different as in a "latent herpes infection".
